It is SEO friendly and gracefully degrades in environments without javascript because firstly all the text is shown, and only when the page is fully loaded the text enclosed by the [wplyrics] text will be hidden, adding a link to make it visible. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload wplyrics folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use the plugin in any post as described (by using [lyrics] and [/lyrics])
